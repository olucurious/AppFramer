Using splash.jpg, timeline.jpg and profile.jpg as examples of screenshots listed in screens.json
The generated output folder will look like this:

│   ├── 3.5
│   │   └── splash.jpg
│   │   ├── timeline.jpg
|	|	├── profile.jpg
|   |
│   ├── 4
│   │   └── splash.jpg
│   │   ├── timeline.jpg
|	|	├── profile.jpg
|   |
│   ├── 4.7
│   │   └── splash.jpg
│   │   ├── timeline.jpg
|	|	├── profile.jpg
|   |
│   ├── 5.5
│   │   └── splash.jpg
│   │   ├── timeline.jpg
|	|	├── profile.jpg

```

### screens.json example
```
Screens.json is obviously a json file format
For iOS, take the screenshots you want to use on iPhone6s preferably because of the high resolution
and list them in your screens.json and appframer will take those screenshots and generate
the screenshots framed in different devices in the dimensions needed for iTunesConnect submission

NOTE: In the screens.json example below, I'm assuming the screenshot images are in the same directory
as the screens.json file itself and I'll be running the command from the same directory

{
    "device_type": "iOS",
    "screens": [
        {
            "file_path": "Live Video.jpeg",
            "title": "Live Video",
            "description": "Rain in Spain falls mainly in the plain",
            "title_color": "black",
            "description_color": "red"
        },
        {
            "file_path": "Profile.jpeg",
            "title": "Profile",
            "description": "Rain in Spain falls mainly in the plain",
            "title_color": "white",
            "description_color": "black"
        },
        {
            "file_path": "Search.jpeg",
            "title": "Search",
            "description": "Rain in Spain falls mainly in the plain",
            "title_color": "white",
            "description_color": "black"
        },
        {
            "file_path": "Status Update.jpeg",
            "title": "Status Update",
            "description": "Rain in Spain falls mainly in the plain",
            "title_color": "black",
            "description_color": "black"
        },
        {
            "file_path": "Timeline.jpeg",
            "title": "Timeline",
            "description": "Rain in Spain falls mainly in the plain",
            "title_color": "white",
            "description_color": "black"
